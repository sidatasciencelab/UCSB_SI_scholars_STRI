# Protocol for field sampling in Gamboa

**Goal:** Conduct an observational field study to determine if vegetation structure influences the animal communities present around Gamboa. Specifically, students will sample birds and their habitat associations on Pipeline Rd. and in the town of Gamboa. 

## Learning objectives: 
 * Set up a field notebook to record field data
 * Use a GPS unit to mark sampling points at a standardized distance
 * Use multiple technologies to record birds and their habitat associations
 * Create a dataset that can be analyzed to compare bird communities in two different habitats (Pipeline Road and Gamboa)
 * Gather data to inform a discussion about how differences in landscape and vegetation provide habitat for different types of animals with different functions. 
 * Discuss how and why habitats are occupied by different types of animal species. 

## Group instruction in Gamboa (~30 minutes-1 hour?)
*	Explain learning objectives
*	How to use a GPS unit
*	How to measure canopy cover with a cell phone
*	How to deploy an audio month
*	How to use Merlin to record birds
*	How to set up a field datasheet
*	We want to record information about a point (GPS location, time of day of sampling) and information about what was at that point at the sampling event (individual birds present). 
*	Which information should be recorded in rows? 
*	Which information should be recorded in columns? 
*	Discuss best data management practices with students: 
*	Should all the information go in one datasheet or should we create two linked datasheets? 
*	How should we link them? 			

## Field sampling instructions:
1.	Students form three groups
2.	Each group needs: 
    *	GPS unit
    *	Audiomoth
    *	Cellphone with Merlin installed
    *	Cellphone with Canopy App installed
    *	Each student should have a field notebook set up to record data including: GPS location, date, time of day, wind and rain conditions, average canopy cover, bird species detected at the point.
3.	Students walk/drive to pipeline road.
4.	All groups take a GPS location at the start of pipeline road. 
    *	Group one stays at the starting location
    *   Group two walks 500m down pipeline road 
    *  	Group three walks 1 km down pipeline road (using GPS to determine when that distance has been covered. 
    *	These are the starting positions for the first point for all groups. 
5.	Each group will observe birds and habitat at three different points, spaced 150m apart. 
6.	At each point: 
    *	Find a good location to deploy the audiomoth
    *	Spent 30 seconds completely quiet and without moving. During this time, you can record wind, rain, time, date, etc. 
    *	For 10 minutes, record all birds detected by you (if you see a bird, try to write down notes about what the bird is) and by Merlin. Keep Merlin running for the full 10 minutes. Record all birds observed by you and merlin in the 10 minute period. Note: Merlin does not have the ability yet to detect all of the birds of Panama. In a real bird survey, observers should be able to identify all the birds of an area (or all the birds of interest to the study) by sight and sound to compliment tools like Merlin.
    *	Each student in the group walks 5-10 steps in a different direction and measures canopy cover with the cell app. 
    *	Average the canopy cover recordings taken by all students and record the average. of the point by averaging the values from each member of the group. 
    *	Before walking to the next point, look at the list of species you observed and use Merlin to learn a little bit about each species. 
        *	In what ways are these species similar? 
        *	In what ways are they different.   
    *	Look at your field notebook and make sure you recorded everything you need to.
    *	With your group, walk 150 m to the next point and repeat the survey. 
    *	After you finish your third point, walk back to the starting location.
7.	Congratulations! You have conducted bird point-count surveys, one of the most common types of field sampling methods used to sample birds.  

### Guiding questions to think about during the data collection: 
1.	Why is it important to record wind and rain conditions?
2.	With points spaced 150 m apart, do you think you will detect the same individual birds at different points? Do you think different birds have different range sizes?
3.	For the birds you detect, are some farther away than others? How might you determine how far away from you a bird is? Why might this be important information to know? 

On a different day, repeat the field sampling instructions with your group in the town of Gamboa. 

When audiomoths are collected, use BirdNet to determine if additional species were detected that can be added to your lists of birds. BirdNet is similar to Merlin but is currently able to detect more species, and individual sonograms can be isolated and identified. But BirdNet requires an internet connection and more computing power, so it may not be the best choice for immediate species identification during field data collection.  

## Data Comparisons
*	With instructors, compare the canopy cover measurements from pipeline road with those in Gamboa. 
*	Discuss the differences you observed in the vegetation structure in both places. 
*	Do the differences in canopy cover reflect the differences you observed in vegetation structure? 
*	What other types of habitat metrics might you want to record to more fully account for differences between the two locations? 
*	Compare the total number of species observed per point in Gamboa and Pipeline Road. 
*	Which had more species? Is this surprising?
*	Compare (whiteboard? Or excel?) the list of species detected in Gamboa and detected on pipeline road.
*	How many species were found in both places? 
*	What do these species eat? Do they eat many types of food or just one? 
*	We call species that can occur in many types of habitats “Habitat generalists.” They tend to do better in agriculture and urban spaces than species that are “forest specialists.” 
*	What species were only found at Pipeline? 
*	What species were only found in Gamboa? 
*	Do you notice any differences in what these species eat? Any other differences? *
