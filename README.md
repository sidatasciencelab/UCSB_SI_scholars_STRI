# UCSB-SI Scholars Summer Trip to STRI in Panama

This repository contains instructional materials for the UCSB-SI Scholars trip to Panama for summer 2023. We expect these materials to be entirely executable in either R Studio or jupyter notebooks using the [Smithsonian Data and Compute Hub (SDCH)](https://smithsonian.2i2c.cloud/). SDCH provides access to both course data and the neccesary compute environment - students are required to select the neccesary server option when logging in to SDCH. The exact server option will be specified at in any .Rmd or .ipynb contained in this repository.

### A draft proposal for summer 2023 curriculum goals and instructional content

The STRI trip combines field excursions, informal biological observation/data collection, site visits to STRIs field research stations, and data science/quanitative ecology workshops to expose students to the array of science opportunities available at STRI and similar locations in the conservation and biodiversity science universe. In 2023 we intend to take advantage of the fact that students will arrive in Panama with a robust introduction to R via their ERES summer workshop experience. Data Science workshops will therefore focus on more advanced computational skills and lean more towards specific scientific concepts rather than a pure coding skills bootcamp. Importantly, we will combine field data collection, aquisition of global datasets via the web, using R as a GIS to analyze geographic data and produce map based visualizations, and
