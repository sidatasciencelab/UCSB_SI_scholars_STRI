# UCSB-SI Scholars Summer Trip to STRI in Panama

This repository contains instructional materials for the UCSB-SI Scholars trip to Panama for summer 2023. We expect these materials to be entirely executable in either R Studio or jupyter notebooks using the [Smithsonian Data and Compute Hub (SDCH)](https://smithsonian.2i2c.cloud/). SDCH provides access to both course data and the neccesary compute environment - students are required to select the neccesary server option when logging in to SDCH. The exact server option will be specified at in any .Rmd or .ipynb contained in this repository.

### A draft proposal for summer 2023 curriculum goals and instructional content

The UCSB-SI Scholars STRI trip combines field excursions, informal biological observation/data collection, site visits to STRI field research stations, and data science/quanitative ecology workshops to expose students to the array of science opportunities available at STRI and similar locations in the conservation and biodiversity science universe. In 2023 we intend to take advantage of the fact that students will arrive in Panama with a robust introduction to R via their ERES summer workshop experience (which for most studenst took place in 2022). Data Science workshops will therefore focus on more advanced computational skills and lean more towards instruction pertaining to specific scientific concepts rather than a pure coding skills bootcamp. We expect to combine field data collection, aquisition of global datasets via the web, using R as a GIS to analyze geographic data and produce map based visualizations, and leveraging the tropics to better understand effective conservation strategies and the basic ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underpinning patterns of global biodiversity. 

The conceptual backdrop of these workshops lead students through computational and field exercices addressing a sequence of 3 scientific ideas/concepts/questions:
1. Why the "tropics"? What makes the tropics unique from a conservation, ecology, and evolution perspective? What unites the Panamanian tropics with other tropical regions around the world. [keywords: Tropical Biology, Conservation Biology, Biogeography, Latitudinal Diversity Gradient]
2. How can we quantify the differences between ecological communities based on the species they contain? How are sun coffee, shade coffee, and forest bird communities different from one another? Do ecological or evolutionary differences between bird species lead to different conclusions about conservation practices for tropical agriculture. [keywords: Agroforestry, Quantitative Ecology, Functional Diversity, Phylogenentic Diversity]
3. What are the gross ecological differences between Barro Colorado Island and Santa Cruz Island? How can we quantify those differences using plant or bird community datasets? Can we visualize the differences between those communities based on the geographic distributions of the species they contain? How might climatic differences between the two islands (e.g., precipitation and precipitation seasonality) help us understand the ecological differences. Historical differences?
